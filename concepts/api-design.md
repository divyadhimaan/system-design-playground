# API Design

## What is APIs?

An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a **software contract** that:

- Defines the **expectations** and **interactions** between external users (clients) and a piece of code (service).
- Specifies:
  - **API Name**
  - **Accepted parameters**
  - **Response structure**
  - **Error messages and codes**

It acts as a well-defined interface for communication between different components or systems.
 
## Goals of Good API Design

To create a reliable and developer-friendly API, aim for:

### 1. **Scalability**
- Supports **increased load** (traffic, data, users) with minimal changes.
- Follows standards that allow **horizontal scaling** (e.g., RESTful resource modeling).

### 2. **Extensibility**
- Easy to **add new features** or **modify behavior** without breaking existing consumers.
- Achieved by:
  - Versioning (`/v1`, `/v2`)
  - Optional parameters
  - Backward-compatible responses

### 3. **Ease of Use**
- Clear, intuitive naming and structure.
- Helpful and consistent error messages.
- Good documentation.

# Scalability: The Basics

> Scalability is the ability of a system to handle increased load by adding resources. 
> It ensures that as demand grows, the system can maintain performance and reliability. There are two main types of scalability: vertical and horizontal.

## Importance of Scalability

- **Managing Growth**: Scalable systems handle more users, data, and traffic without losing speed or reliability, enabling long-term business growth.
- **Increasing Performance**: Distributing load across multiple servers boosts processing speed, improves response times, and delivers a smoother user experience.
- **Ensuring Availability**: Scalability maintains uptime during traffic spikes or component failures, which is essential for mission-critical applications.
- **Cost-effectiveness**: Resources can scale up or down based on demand, preventing overprovisioning and reducing infrastructure costs.
- **Encouraging Innovation**: With fewer infrastructure limits, teams can build and ship new features faster, helping businesses stay competitive.

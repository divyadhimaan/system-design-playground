# Consistency 

In distributed systems, consistency means how up-to-date a piece of data is.

## Why is consistency important? 

- A highly consistent system reflects all updates to data, while an inconsistent system provides stale data. 
- Consistency is important because highly consistent systems are easier to reason about and provide a better user experience.
